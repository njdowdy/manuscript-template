# Contributing

### Welcome

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! The following document outlines some guidelines for making contributions.

### Why Guidelines?

Following these guidelines helps to ensure further development efforts are efficient and transparent.

### What kinds of contributions are accepted?

We accept many types of contributions, including:
 - Improvements to documentation
 - Writing tutorials
 - Submitting bug reports
 - Submitting feature requests
 - Writing new or improved code which can be incorporated into the project
 
### What kinds of contributions are not currently accepted?

There are currently no restrictions.

# Ground Rules
### Expectations
Some guidelines on how we expect contributions to be made:
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds
  * We follow the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

# Getting started
## Submission Walkthrough

###Small Contributions:
These are fixes that typically do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking.

####Examples:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like .gitignore, build scripts, etc.

###Large Contributions:
These are larger fixes and additions that introduce new functionality.

####Process:
1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Follow code styling guidelines
    * Send pull request


# Reporting Bugs
### Explain security disclosures first!

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Notify a maintainer directly instead.


In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. 

**Note: if you are unsure, notify a maintainer directly instead.**


### Filing A Bug Report

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of the software are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

**General questions should not go to the issue tracker**

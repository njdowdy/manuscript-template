# Contributing

### Welcome

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! The following document outlines some guidelines for making contributions.

### Why Guidelines?

Following these guidelines helps to ensure further development efforts are efficient and transparent.

### What kinds of contributions are accepted?

We accept many types of contributions, including:
 - Improvements to documentation
 - Writing tutorials
 - Submitting bug reports
 - Submitting feature requests
 - Writing new or improved code which can be incorporated into the project
 
### What kinds of contributions are not currently accepted?

There are currently no restrictions.

# Ground Rules
### Expectations
Some guidelines on how we expect contributions to be made:
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds

The **Code of Conduct** for this community can be found [here](https://github.com/{USERNAME}/{REPO-NAME}/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

# Getting started
## Submission Walkthrough

###Small Contributions:
These are fixes that typically do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking.

####Examples:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like .gitignore, build scripts, etc.

###Large Contributions:
These are larger fixes and additions that introduce new functionality.

####Process:
1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Follow code styling guidelines
    * Send pull request


# Reporting Bugs
### Explain security disclosures first!

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Notify a maintainer directly instead.


In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. 

**Note: if you are unsure, notify a maintainer directly instead.**
